<h1 align="center">Features</h1>

### Performance
Having poured lots of hours into examining generated C# code and its JIT assembly, you can count on us to deliver blazing fast bindings with negligible overhead induced by Silk.NET!

### Up-to-date
With an efficient bindings regeneration mechanism, we are committed to ensuring our bindings reflect the latest specifications with frequent updates generated straight from the upstream sources.

### High-level utilities
In addition to providing high-speed, direct, and transparent bindings, we provide high-level utilities and wrappers to maximise productivity in common workloads such as platform-agnostic abstractions around Windowing and Input, bringing your apps to a vast number of platforms without changing a single line!

### Good-to-go
Silk.NET caters for anything you could need in swift development of multimedia, graphics, compute applications. Silk.NET is an all-in-one solution, complete with Graphics, Compute, Audio, Input, and Windowing.

<h1 align="center">Building from source</h1>

Prerequisites
- **Must**: .NET 6 SDK
- **Should**: [NUKE](https://nuke.build) (build system). Install using `dotnet tool install Nuke.GlobalTool --global`
- **Should**: Android, iOS, and MAUI .NET 6 workloads (use `dotnet workload install android ios maccatalyst maui` to install them)
- **Should**: Android SDK version 30 with NDK tools installed. On Windows, for best results this should be installed into `C:\ProgramData\Android\android-sdk`.
- **Could**: Java JDK (for gradle)
- **Could**: Visual Studio 2022 Community version 17.0 or later

Instructions
- Clone the repository (recursively)
- Run build.sh, build.cmd, build.ps1, or `nuke compile`.
- Use the DLLs. To get nupkgs you can use with NuGet instead, use `nuke pack`.

There are more advanced build actions you can do too, such as FullBuild, Pack, FullPack, among others which you can view by doing `nuke --plan`.

Note: Some .NET 6 workloads are only supported on Windows and macOS today.
